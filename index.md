## Working Experience

### 01.AI, Multimodal Algorithm (Intern)
- Digtial Human Matting (Digtial human group, 2024.11-2025.02)
- a) Project Implementation - **Digital Human Video Matting**:
- Built an internal real-world dataset and reproduced mainstream algorithms (MaGGIe/RVM/RMBG/BiRefNet, etc.), selecting solutions based on usage scenarios. Identified limitations in current algorithms, such as their inability to consider video temporal constraints or handle complex backgrounds.
- To address these challenges, introduced efficient fine-grained segmentation with temporal information through Textual Guided Video Segmentation, further optimizing the prediction results of RMBG model.
- **This optimization corrected more than 95% of the errors in previously identified Bad Cases for the RMBG model, improved the overall prediction quality by approximately 10% on an internally constructed real-world dataset**, significantly enhancing the model’s robustness for practical applications. 


### DENSO (China),Deep Learning Algorithm (Intern)
- Passenger Status Detection (Algorithm study group, 2024.08-2024.11)
- a) Research and Development:
  - Conducted research and reproduction of mainstream algorithms (HintAD/VAD/UniAD/Motion Transformer, etc.), with evaluations of usage scenarios and business applicability
- b) Project Implementation - **Intelligent Cabin Detection**:
  - Built a high-quality training dataset collection pipeline based on real-world vehicle front camera data, utilizing SAM2 for automatic annotation and introducing temporal optimization
  - Contributed to the development of specific functions in the intelligent cabin system by designing and improving a detection process based on DETR, monitoring the number of occupants and their status inside the vehicle. **Achieved an Avg F1-score of 0.983+ for seatbelt status classification and an R2-score of 0.929+ for facial angle regression**
